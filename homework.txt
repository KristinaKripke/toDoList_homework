    * A form field element should have an id or name attribute

## Issues: 
    Inconsistent character case (All - active - Completed)
    Item count starts on 0. Second item added becomes '1 item left'.
    Item count is inaccurate, doesn't update on clear.
    Item count is not option specific, the same on all tabs.
    Down arrow to select items needs to be double clicked to disselect items.
    If there's only one item on the list and it's marked as completed the item count is negative (-1 items left) in the 'All' tab.
    If there's only one item on the list and it's marked as completed the item count is negative (-1 items left) in the 'active' tab.
    Trying to close the list marks all the items as completed.
    Clear only works on selected/deleted items.
    After all items are deleted or manyally removed 'What need's to be added?' doesn't load unless the page if reloaded.
    After task is added three spaces are left in the entry field.
